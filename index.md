Γεια σασ, my name is Constantine Nicolaou.

### Experience

A technical leader with architectural skills and experience in industry and Tech Startups.

I work for [Keeward Holding Group](http://keeward.com/the-teams/) as Solution Architect. I am responsible for designing and implementing cloud-based solutions to scale operations and infrastructure.

### Skills

*Startup experience*

Learning and practicing customer discovery and design thinking has changed my professional life. I highly recommend Steve Blank's book [The Startup Owner's Manual](https://www.bookwitty.com/product/97809849993090000000?tap_a=30133-3fb7e6&tap_s=223446-11c47b) to anyone who is on the path of starting a new company.

*Technical experience*

I've previously designed and built cloud service models including Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-Service for several startups, SMEs and mid-size companies.

*Cloud & SaaS Platforms:*

Amazon, Google Web Services and Alibaba Cloud

*Architectural Experience:*

Python, Ruby, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Flask, Symphony

### Community building

Back in January 2015, I started [MENA devs](http://menadevs.com), an initiative with the purpose of connecting software developers, designers and computer enthusiasts in the MENA region.

What started as a Slack group quickly evolved to an active community, reaching more than 300 members and lead by [dedicated members](https://github.com/mena-devs).
