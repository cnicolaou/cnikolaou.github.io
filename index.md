Hello, my name is Constantine Nicolaou.

I am a software developer with experience in Tech startups.

I am currently working at [Keeward Holding group](http://keeward.com/the-teams/), an innovative digital production company working across continents, cultures and languages.

I am currently working on several challenges ranging from Social Analytics and Big Data to scaling technical infrastructure.

Back in January 2015, with the help of dedicated community members, I started [MENA Devs](http://menadevs.com), a community initiative for developers in the MENA regions.

To contact me: email AT cnicolaou DOT com
