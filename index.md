Hello, my name is Constantine Nicolaou. I am Greek - Lebanese and live in Beirut, Lebanon.

### Experience

Solutions Architect with [+15 years experience in software, industry and Tech Startups](http://cnicolaou.github.io/resume/).

I work for [Keeward Holding Group](http://keeward.com/the-teams/) on projects related to Big Data, User/Social Analytics, Machine Learning and scaling technical and business operations.

### Skills

Learning and practicing customer discovery has changed my professional life. I highly recommend Steve Blank's book [The Startup Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-Step/dp/0984999302) to anyone who is on the path of starting a new company.

My experience ranges from designing systems and infrastructure to production deployment.

My technical skills are focused around Ruby and Python ecosystems. I also have experience building iOS mobile apps and web interfaces.

### Activities

Back in January 2015, I started [MENA devs](http://menadevs.com), an initiative with the purpose of connecting software developers, designers and computer enthusiasts in the MENA region.
What started as a Slack group quickly evolved to an active community, reaching more than 250 members, lead by [dedicated members](https://github.com/mena-devs).
