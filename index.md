Hello and welcome to my personal page.

### Experience

[+15 years experience in industry and Tech Startups](http://cnicolaou.github.io/resume/).

Solution Architect focusing on Cloud Computing, User/Social Analytics and scaling technical infrastructures.

### Skills

Learning and practicing customer discovery has changed my professional life. I highly recommend Steve Blank's book [The Startup Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-Step/dp/0984999302) to anyone who is on the path of starting a new company.

My experience ranges from designing architectures for technical solutions, to development and deployment to production.

My technical skills are focused around Ruby, Rails and Python ecosystems.

### Activities

Back in January 2015, I started [MENA devs](https://menadevs.com), an initiative with the purpose of connecting software developers, designers and computer enthusiasts in the MENA region.
What started as a Slack group quickly evolved to an active community, reaching more than 300 members and lead by [dedicated members](https://github.com/mena-devs).
