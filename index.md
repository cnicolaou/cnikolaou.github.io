### Community building

Back in January 2015, I started [MENA devs](http://menadevs.com), an initiative with the purpose of connecting software developers, designers and computer enthusiasts in the MENA region.

What started as a Slack group quickly evolved to an active community, reaching more than 300 members and lead by [dedicated members](https://github.com/mena-devs).
