Hello, my name is Constantine Nicolaou.

I am a software developer with experience in Tech startups.

After my last startup experience, I joined [Keeward Holding group](http://keeward.com/the-teams/) in August 2016, an innovative digital production company working across continents, cultures and languages.

I am currently working on several challenges ranging from Social Analytics to scaling technical infrastructure.

My technical background is mainly focused around Ruby, Rails and Python.

Back in January 2015, with the help of dedicated community members, I started [MENA Devs](http://menadevs.com), a community initiative for developers in the MENA region.

I am a Greek national and currently residing in Beirut, Lebanon.
