Hello, my name is Constantine Nicolaou. I am a Greek national currently residing in Beirut, Lebanon

### Experience

I am a Software Architect & Technical Lead with [experience in Tech Startups](http://cnicolaou.github.io/resume/).

After my last startup experience around business referrals, I joined [Keeward Holding Group](http://keeward.com/the-teams/) in August 2016 as System Architect.

I am currently working on projects related to social analytics, machine learning and scaling technical infrastructures.

### Skills

Learning and practicing customer discovery has changed my professional life. I highly recommend Steve Blank's book [The Startup Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-Step/dp/0984999302) to anyone who is on the path of starting a new company.

My technical skills are focused around Ruby, Rails and Python ecosystems.

### Activities

Back in January 2015, I started [MENA Devs](http://menadevs.com), an initiative with the purpose of connecting software developers, designers and computer enthusiasts in the MENA region.
What started as a Slack group quickly evolved to an active community lead by [dedicated members](https://github.com/mena-devs).
